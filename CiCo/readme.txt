This is the system folder
You must make changes to:

1) header.txt
Include information about the company. 
You probably want to include the name and address

2) people.xls
Fill in with employees' names, and later uses the 'Enroll Fingerprint.py' to capture the fingerprint and save it at the same position listed in this file.
Better to list everyone twice, and then enrol two different fingers of the same person.
